        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, green onions, lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved.
                Adjust the flavor, if desired, by adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer steak to a chopping board and slice into thin strips; add steak and its juices into the bowl with herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Place lettuce in a salad bowl; arrange cucumber on top. Add steak and pour all of the herb mixture on top. Scatter cherry tomatoes over salad and garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
        </ol>
